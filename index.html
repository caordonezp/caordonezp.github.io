            <h3>About Me</h3>
           
        <p>I am a behavioral and cognitive scientist. My research focuses on decision-making processes, particularly in four key areas:</p>

        <h4>Behavioral Science</h4>
        <p>I explore how to design and evaluate <strong>nudge interventions</strong> that promote:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Honest behaviors, helping to mitigate corruption.</li>
            <li>Pro-environmental actions, particularly those addressing climate change.</li>
            <li>Self-care behaviors, such as reducing vape use and increasing physical activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am especially interested in understanding how material and social incentives can be used effectively in shaping behavior.</p>

        <h4>Perception</h4>
        <p>My work examines the direct connections between <strong>perceptual content and behavior</strong>, emphasizing the role of bottom-up attention in decision-making processes.</p>

        <h4>Thought and Decision-Making</h4>
        <p>I investigate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The links between categorization, judgment, and behavior.</li>
            <li>The development of an integrative theory of biases and heuristics in decision-making.</li>
            <li>The potential of artificial intelligence in creating hybrid systems for problem-solving, especially in educational contexts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Social Psychology</h4>
        <p>I study how individuals navigate conflicts between personal norms (moral, strategic, prudential) and the social norms of their groups. Additionally, I examine how beliefs about justice —whether the world is fair, whether they are being treated fairly, or whether a distribution is just—impact their behavior.</p>

        <p>Beyond academia, I’m deeply passionate about spending time with my family, playing the guitar, and running. </p>
